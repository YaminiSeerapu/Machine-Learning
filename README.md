# Machine-Learning
This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression. These algorithms serve as building blocks for more complex machine learning models and are essential to understand for anyone diving into the field of data science and machine learning.

Linear Regression with Random Numbers:
Python implementation of linear regression using random numbers. The code generates random input data, performs linear regression, and plots the true values along with the predicted values on a linear line.

Logistic Regression with Iris Dataset:
Python code to demonstrate logistic regression using the famous Iris dataset. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing datasets where the outcome variable is binary, in this case, whether a flower is Iris-Virginica (1) or not (0) based on its petal width. This generates a plot showing the logistic regression model's probabilities for being Iris-Virginica and not being Iris-Virginica based on petal width. Additionally, the script predicts the class labels for specific petal widths.
